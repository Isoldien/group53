# Group 53 — CS2TP Team Project (Aston University)

Repository for Group 53's E‑Commerce website project, developed as part of the CS2TP 2025–26 module.

## Quick summary

This project is an e‑commerce website focused on pet products (toys, food, clothing, healthcare, etc.). The goal is to design, implement, and deploy a functional full‑stack web application that meets the client requirements for product management, order processing and a polished user experience.

Status: In development — the repository will grow to include React components, Laravel backend and database configuration.

## What you'll find in this repository

- `index.html` — the current frontend entry (starting point).
- `README.md` — this file.

*Backend code, database schema and CI/deployment configuration will be added as development continues*

## Features & objectives

- Product catalogue and product detail pages
- Inventory and product management (admin side)
- Shopping cart and order processing
- User-friendly responsive UI (desktop & mobile)
- Deployment on the university provided server

## Tech stack (planned)

- Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript and React
- Backend: Laravel (PHP)
- Database: To be decided (MySQL or PostgreSQL)
- Hosting: University-provided server
- Version control: Git (GitHub remote)

## Local preview (quick)

If you want to preview the current static frontend quickly, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser or, if you use VS Code, install the Live Server extension and click "Go Live".

## Development workflow

- Branching: create feature branches off `develop` (e.g. `feature/login`, `feature/product-api`).
- Commits: keep messages small and descriptive. Use PRs to merge into `develop` and `main` after review.
- Tests & linting: will be decided later.

## File / directory plan (expected)

As the project develops we'll likely have a structure similar to:

```
- frontend/
	- public/
	- src/ (React components)
	- package.json
- backend/
	- app/
	- routes/
	- database/
	- composer.json
- docs/
```

The layout will reflect the frameworks and tooling we adopt.

## Next steps / TODO

- Decide on the database engine and add configuration
- Add backend and start working on Laravel and API endpoints
- Convert static pages into React components
- Testing and then deployment to the university server
